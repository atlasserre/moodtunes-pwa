git commit -m "Add comprehensive CI/CD pipeline with testing"
git push origin main
```

### **2. Verify GitHub Actions**
1. Go to your **GitHub repository**
2. Click **"Actions"** tab
3. You should see **two workflows**:
   - `MoodTunes CI/CD Pipeline` 
   - `MoodTunes Tests`

### **3. Configure Auto-Deploy in Render**
1. **Render Dashboard** → Your service
2. **Settings** → **Auto-Deploy**: ✅ **Enabled**
3. **Build Command**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. **Start Command**: `gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT app_production:app`

## 🎯 **What Happens When You Push Code**

### **Automatic Process:**
1. **Code Push** → GitHub triggers pipeline
2. **Quality Checks** → Black, Flake8, Security scans
3. **Unit Tests** → All 15 playlists validated
4. **Integration Tests** → Full app endpoint testing
5. **Performance Audit** → Lighthouse scoring
6. **Deploy** → Automatic deployment to Render (if main branch)
7. **Health Check** → Post-deployment verification

### **Quality Gates:**
- ❌ **Deployment BLOCKED** if any test fails
- ✅ **Deployment PROCEEDS** only if all checks pass
