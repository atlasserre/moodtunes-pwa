## 🚀 Your App is Now Mobile-Ready!

---

## ⚡ Quick Setup (5 Minutes)

### 1. **Replace Icon Placeholders**
The app has placeholder icons. For a professional look:

**Option A: Use Online Generator (Recommended)**
1. Go to [RealFaviconGenerator.net](https://realfavicongenerator.net/)
2. Upload a 512x512 image with music theme (🎵 or MoodTunes logo)
3. Download and replace files in `/static/icons/`

**Option B: Use Existing Placeholders**
The app will work with current placeholders, but won't look as polished.

### 2. **Start Your Mobile App**
```bash
# Navigate to your app folder
cd "C:\Users\F266735\Downloads\MoodTunes"

# Start the server (accessible from phone)
python app.py
```

### 3. **Get Your Computer's IP**
```powershell
ipconfig | findstr IPv4
```
Note the IP address (like `192.168.1.105`)

### 4. **Install on Android**
1. **Same WiFi**: Ensure phone and computer are on same network
2. **Open Chrome** on your Android phone
3. **Visit**: `http://YOUR_IP:5000` (e.g., `http://192.168.1.105:5000`)
4. **Install**: Tap install banner or Chrome menu → "Add to Home screen"
